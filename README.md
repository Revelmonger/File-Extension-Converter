# File-Extension-Converter

A program to convert all files in a chosen directory from one file extension to another.



There is currently a bug where the "setHighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy" enviroment variable doesn't get set properly. This seems to be a known issue with some PyQt6 versions.





To get started clone the repository and simply run the installRequirments.bat followed by the runApp.bat
